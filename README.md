# DGIST-SNUH-DBS-analysis
**Abstract**

It is a repository of the codes for the SVM model and statistical analysis used in a paper handling deep brain stimulation on Parkinson's disease patients, written by DGIST and Seoul National University Hospital.

Source data of the paper are in the folder ```data``` (**currently not provided in this repo. before acceptance or publication**). Every graph and analysis result used in the paper can be generated by executing main.py and saved under ```results``` folder that would be created by the code.

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This project aims to:

- Compute biomarker differences (diff) per channel under different stimulation conditions
- Label examples (True/False) based on `optv` values and burst criteria
- Train and evaluate classification models (Support Vector Machine; SVM)
- Generate ROC curves, confusion matrices, and statistical test results
- Reproduce the result figures/tables under `results/`
- Enable external researchers to reproduce the same results

---

## 2. Repository Structure
- `data/`: input datasets
- `main.py`: orchestrates full analysis
- `Classifier_funcs_with_label.py`: biomarker diff, labeling, model functions
- `Statistics_funcs.py`: statistical tests, group comparisons
- `requirements.txt`: library dependencies
- `results/`: output figures, tables, CSVs

---

## 3. Environment & Dependencies

- Python 3.12.7  
- Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
